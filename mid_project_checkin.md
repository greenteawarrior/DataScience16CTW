# Change the World Project

###### Did you accomplish your goals?  If not, what happened
Our goals for this checkin were to have created some visualizations inspired  by our axes of diversity, 
looked into some qualitative resources/papers, read the paper associated with our original dataset, and to have used jupyter
notebooks as a prototyping ground for our visualizations.
- First, it is important to note that we have pivoted in our project a bit. We are no longer using the original dataset on neuroimaging and relating depression and bipolar disorder. 
We did not feel it aligned well with providing an opportunity to explore the impact of mental illnesses on people and the impacts of other factors on the prevalance of mental illnesses that we wanted to explore for this project.
We have chosen instead to use data from the National Survey on Substance Abuse. Because of this, our primary focus will be on the intersection of substance abuse and addiction with other mental illnesses.

- We have created some visualizations, although we have not explored as many of our original axes of diversity as we would have hoped.
This is largely due to the nature of the data we are using. We be delving into as many of these axes of diversity as is possible given the data available to us.
Most of what we have explored so far has been more about substance abuse specifically. We have looked into factors that may contribute to addiction, such as how early in life people were introduced to these substances. 
The thing we have spent the most time looking into so far is the impact that drug use has on various aspects of a person's mental/emotional health. This is what we have generated the most useful visualizations for thus far.

- We no longer found the paper associated wtih our original dataset to be useful or relevant to our project. We have however, read through much of the documentation and codebook associated with the dataset we are now using.

- We have been using Jupyter notebooks as a prototyping ground for our visualizations and have been looking into what we want to visualize and how.


###### What have you accomplished thus far in the project?  Make sure to provide pointers to any intermediate artifacts generated from your project.  These artifacts could be code, plots, data, etc.
- The drug_usage_health_intro.ipynb Jupyter notebook is an artifact of the progress we have made in our code and visualizations. We have also made much progress in thinking about the higher level
aspect of our project: what are goals are, how we want to present our findings, and how to use what we learn from the data to tell a truthful meaningful story that people will be able to connect to
at a level far beyond that of raw numbers and summary statistics. 

###### What is the minimum viable product that you will have done by next Friday?  What are your stretch goals?

- Minimum viable product: Portfolio style document containing a narrative that shows the reader what we have learned from the dataset. Visualizations about mental and emotional impact of substance abuse as well as the impact on families and friends of people who abuse substances. 
- Stretch goals:  Ted-Talk Style Presentation about our findings. Explore more axes of diversity.
