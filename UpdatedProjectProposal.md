# Change the World Project Proposal
### Emily Wang & Brenna Manning
### Data Science Spring 2016
--------
###### Summary of the Project
Main Idea - Exploring substance abuse and mental health, using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health  
Features to Explore:
Substances Used - how frequently? for how long?
Emotional States - what do people feel? How does this relate to substances?
Impact on life  - how does substance use/emotional state impact other aspects of life


Ability
We will be exploring the data and creating visualizations about what we find, with a focus on increasing awareness as well as delving deeper into potential opportunities for impact. 

MVP
Exploration and deeper understanding of dataset with different axes of diversity
Visualizations of data across our axes of diversity in a polished jupyter notebook

Stretch Goals
Create visualizations for potential opportunities for impact.

In what way will it change the world?
Making the abstract stuff more tangible/visible to people, and extracting it into an artifact. Raising awareness of substance abuse and other mental illnesses, where they exist and how they are often present.


What do we want to learn?
Data cleaning/engineering
Dataset explorations 
Representing our insights
Communication skills
Infographics/Portfolio
Design skills
Creating clear concise visualizations

Where will we get the data for our project?
Primary source: www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34933.

Additional resources
Visual Display of Quantitative Information - Edward Tufte

Final Deliverable:
We would like to create a bridge to bring this information into a larger context.
jupyter notebooks: the prototyping ground for our explorations and data-driven graphics
Posters or Portfolio of Visualizations: compelling graphics that tell a story to the population at large and future policymakers. 

Workflow and Schedule
Suggested Schedule (will reflect and edit accordingly throughout the project)
Fri Feb 26 (Class) 
Project Proposal due before 9am
Saturday Feb-27 Meeting 
Read documents
Working with the data
(Independently) Background Info from other sources
Monday Feb-29 Meeting 
jupyter Notebook prototypes of data visualization
Tues March 1 (Class)
Mystery
Sanity check on progress: Edit the plan and rescope if needed
Wed March-2 Meeting
Dependent on what we learn the first few meetings
Should be making good progress towards mid-project check in (see below)
Thursday-Saturday March 3-5 Independent Work
Should be making good progress towards mid-project check in (see below)
Fri March 4 (Class) Mid Project Check-In
mid_project_checkin.md in GitHub repo
Scope out the following week (portfolio, video presentation, both/either, etc.)
Tues March 8 (Class)
TBD
Fri March 11 (Class) Final Output and Reflection Due

Support for this schedule and collaboration style:
Includes both independent work time (for reading up on external sources) and team meetings for exploration, discussion, and prototyping deliverables (first in jupyter notebooks, then in a more formal portfolio and/or presentation)
Significant progress made before every Data Science class session to prevent all of it happening at the last minute. 

Mid-project Check-in (Fri March 4)
Some visualizations inspired by our axes of diversity
Some qualitative resources/papers
Read paper associated with dataset
Jupyter Notebooks as prototyping ground
Assessment
Note: Currently these seem more like feedback/discussion points rather than explicit properties to be assessed. We hope to have more concrete assessment points soon; perhaps we can discuss this list with Paul more in person. :-)

Jupyter Notebooks
Feedback on software engineering practices (helper functions, readability, etc.)
Narration of code, process, learning about the techniques, and learning about the data
Visualization Portfolio
Should be polished
Narrative feedback on whether the visualizations are misleading, easy to understand, etc. -- design decisions for communicating via graphics
Video Presentation
Comments on presentation style
Was the audience confused? Did the audience understand our message?

Notes from Fri Feb 26 Class

DATA JOURNALISM!

Doing some things from Think Stats -- simulation based approach to verifying trends and wondering if they’re just random chance or something

Along with narrative, have data 

It’s easy to talk about it qualitatively, but the added quantitative stuff makes it even more compelling

FiveThirtyEight - website and GitHub repo of daaaaata

disclaimer: Data Vis is a HUGE topic, here’s a taste from Paul
links to articles with interesting takes on the subject

3D pie charts are terribad
lots of effort to match colors with key
3D perspective is misleading here
no quantitative stuff on it

Happy medium between minimalism and labels/communication

Accessibility -- check out the data dashboard design link

Applying good vis principles to scientific papers (y)

Story telling! data and emotional experience of looking at it

Tension between scientific approach (discover, present findings clearly, however do not easily make strong claims bc it is dangerous to see too much in your data) and journalistic one (telling a story with the data, which is a claim in itself)
