In this supplemental report we include more visualizations and explanations of what we have observed. It is created for the more motivated reader.

Other documents, such as the ipython notebooks included in this repo show much of our progress throughout the project, though some are more polished than others. They were used as a prototping ground and are not final deliverables.
